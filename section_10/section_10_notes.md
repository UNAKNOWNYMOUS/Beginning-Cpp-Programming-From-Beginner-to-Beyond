# Characters and Strings
## Section Overview
- Use C++ strings for modern C++.
- Methods are functions that work with objects.
## Character Functions
- Character functions:
```cpp
#include <cctype>

function_name(char)

// Functions for testing characters
// Functions for converting character case
```
## C-Style Strings
- C-Style strings are:
  - Sequence of characters.
  - Contiguous in memory.
  - Implemented as an array of characters.
  - Terminated by a null character (null).
    - null - character with a value of zero.
  - Referred to as zero or null terminated strings.
- String literal:
  - Sequence of characters in double quotes.
  - Constant.
  Terminated with null character.
- Array names and literals evaluate to their location in memory.
