# Statements and Operators
## Section Overview
## Expressions and Statements
- An expression is:
  - This most basic building block of a program.
  - "a sequence of operators and operands that specifies a computation"
  - Computes a value from a number of operands.
  - There is much, much more to expressions!!!
- A statement is:
  - A complete line of code that performs some action.
  - Usually terminated with a semi-colon.
  - Usually contain expressions.
  - C++ has many types of statements:
    - expression, null, compound, selection, iteration, declaration, jump, try blocks, and others.
## Using Operators
## The Assignment Operator
- Initialization and assignment are not the same!
- Initialization happens when the variable is declared and it gets that value for the first time.
- Assignment is when you change a value that already exists in the variable.
- l-value and r-value in C++.
- C++ is statically typed! A lot of checking happens during compile time!
## Arithmetic Operators
## Coding Exercise 7
- [x] Using the Assignment Operator
## Coding Exercise 8
- [x] Using the Arithmetic Operators
## Increment and Decrement Operators
- NEVER use it twice for the same variable in the same statement!!
  - Undefined!
