# Introduction
## About the Course
## Why Learn C++?
- C++ is a general purpose programming language that supports both procedural and object-oriented programming.
## Modern C++ and the C++ Standard
- Pre C++11 Standard is known as Classical C++.
- C++11, C++14, C++17 is known as Modern C++.
## How does all this work?
- The computer does exactly the programmer instructs it to do.
- Computer program is like a recipe.
- The code we write is called source code.
- Source code is generally higher-level than machine code because it needs to be understood by humans.
- We use editors for programming.
- We need to translate the source code written by humans to a language a computer can understand.
  - This form is called object code.
- The compiler is a program that takes source code and produces object code.
- Linker takes objects codes and links it together to produce an executable.
