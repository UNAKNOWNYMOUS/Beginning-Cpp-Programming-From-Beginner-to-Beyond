# Getting Started
## Section Overview
## An Overview of the CodeLite Interface
## Writing our first program
- The whole process of compiling and linking is called *building*.
## Building our first program
## What are Compiler Errors?
- Programming languages have very specific rules about how to write code so that the compiler can translate that code to machine code.
- Syntax errors - something wrong with the structure.
- Semantic errors - something wrong with the meaning.
## What are Compiler Warnings?
- Do not ignore compiler warnings!
- The compiler has recognized an issue with your code that could lead to a potential problem.
- It's only a warning because the compiler is still able to generate correct machine code.
## What are Linker Errors?
## What are Runtime Errors?
- Runtime errors are errors that occur when the program is executing.
## What are Logic Errors?
- Logic errors are errors or bugs in your code that cause your program to run incorrectly.
## Section Challenge.
